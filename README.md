# DataSourceable presentation

Material used for the presentation [Niels van Hoorn](http://twitter.com/nvh) gave at [CocoaHeadsNL](http://www.cocoaheads.nl) on Januari 13 2016 at Q42.

The playground is the final playground of the live coding session.

[DataSourceable](https://github.com/nvh/DataSourceable) is a library that implements an extended version the same principles as this demo.

Video footage of the presentation will be available at some point in the future.
